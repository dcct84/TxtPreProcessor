228,ITEM-187044,Energy Regulation in face of Innovation The discussion workshop is expected to understand what are the key regulatory tools that may help them to keep the pace of innovation? What are (or were) the main barriers of current regulation in Europe and United States to the adoption of new technologies? How the regulatory framework in Europe and United States are changing to include the new technologies and how it has changed the energy markets?  This workshop aligns with the demand on the Energy Division to understand better the regulatory changes necessary to adapt the region to the innovation. It is a clear demand received by the thematic group of Energy Regulation and Policy. This also contributes to the evidence-based policy discussion of the knowledge agenda in the Economic Sector Work of the Energy Sector (which underline the importance to strength regulation and governance) as well as IDB’s flagship report DIA : Improving the Infrastructure Services in Latin America and Caribbean.  The DIA  aims to focus on how we should adapt the future and the regulatory framework is big part of it because it can adapt to innovation pushing it to solve the current challenges or it can block it. It will be key to Energy Staff to think about new solutions and tools. Moreover the dissemination of the event and the document will also help us to position the IADB as leader in these topics being a bridge between IDB and the regulatory counterparts in the region in terms of () identifying major challenges coming with technology innovations; () providing best practices in the global energy sector; () exploring ad hoc regulatory role and rules in the region.,Ingles
